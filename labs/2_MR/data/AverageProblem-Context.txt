Notice the first value in each row is a county name, followed by the state. 
The third value is a unique ID for the county. The remaining values represent median 
incomes from various years. 
For example, the 10th value in each row is the median household income for that county 
for the year 2000. This is the column you are going to compute the average of for each 
state.
